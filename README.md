# A MICRO ARCHITECTURE TO IMPLEMENT RV32I Instruction set  

RISC-V is a free and open ISA enabling a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration. 


Summary:
The complete implementation of sequential calculator has been done and also the  pipelining has been implemented on it
The complete implementation of riscv has been done and problems of readwrite hazard and branch hazard and load hazard had been addressed.
The codes can be seen in  Day3-5 and Day2 folder
